# tennis-shot-tree
Prediction algorithm that determines next best shot based on current rally

# training data:
https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_MatchChartingProject

Due to space concerns, the raw data is excluded from this git repo.

# setting up the project:
Source code is stored in the ```src/``` directory.

Data is stored in ```data/``` with each category of data being stored in its own subfolder.

- For example: raw data is stored in ```data/raw/```

All files should be run from the parent directory, not the ```src/``` folder.

- For example: ```usr@tennis-shot-tree: python3 src/parse-raw-data.py```
