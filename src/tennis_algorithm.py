        Important things to remember:
        In tennis the server switches sides after each point (alternate deuce/ad)
        However, the serves are coded wide/body/T 
            which means a wide serve on the deuce side goes to the opponent's FOREHAND (right side)
            but the same wide serve on the ad side will go to the opponent's BACKHAND (left side)
            And it flips if one of the opponents is left-handed
        
        10-point tie-break scoring:
            Decide who serves first
            Person serving first serves for one point
            after that, each player serves twice before switching who serves
            Example: p1 serves, p2 serves, p2 serves, p1 serves, p1 serves, etc
        
        If the score is 9 - 9, the next point wins.
        This is generally not how scoring works in the actual game (most tournaments will play win-by-two)
        but for this demonstration it will work well enough
